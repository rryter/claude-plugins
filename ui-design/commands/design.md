# UI Design Generator

You are tasked with creating 3 different UI design variations based on this brief:

**Brief:** {{arg}}

## Process:

### Step 0: Parse Flags and Variation Count

First, parse the brief for flags and variation count:

**A. Check for Validation Flag:**

- If `--validate` or `-v` is present: Set `AUTO_VALIDATE=true` and remove the flag from the brief
- Otherwise: Set `AUTO_VALIDATE=false` and prompt user later

**B. Determine Variation Count:**

- Look for `--count=N`, `--variations=N`, or `-n N` in the brief
- If found: Set `VARIATION_COUNT=N` and remove the flag from the brief
- If not found: Set `VARIATION_COUNT=2` (default)
- **Constraints**: Minimum 1, Maximum 5

Examples:

- Input: `"create a dashboard --validate --count=3"` → Brief: `"create a dashboard"`, AUTO_VALIDATE=true, VARIATION_COUNT=3
- Input: `"create a dashboard -n 4"` → Brief: `"create a dashboard"`, AUTO_VALIDATE=false, VARIATION_COUNT=4
- Input: `"create a dashboard"` → Brief: `"create a dashboard"`, AUTO_VALIDATE=false, VARIATION_COUNT=2 (default)

### Step 1: Brainstorm Design Variations

First, analyze the brief and determine a consistent **feature-name** following these rules:

- Use kebab-case (lowercase with hyphens)
- 2-4 words maximum
- Descriptive but concise
- Valid directory name (no spaces, special characters, or slashes)
- Examples: "dashboard", "profile-editor", "analytics-view", "code-review"

**Feature Name:** [feature-name]

Validate this name before proceeding. It will be used in all directory paths and must follow the rules above.

Then propose **VARIATION_COUNT** distinct design approaches. Consider:

- Different layout patterns (e.g., dashboard grid, wizard flow, card-based, list-detail, kanban)
- Different visual styles (e.g., minimal/clean, data-dense, illustrative, modern/bold)
- Different user flows and interaction patterns
- Information hierarchy and focus areas
- Target audience needs and use case priorities

Document your design variations clearly (repeat for each variation from 1 to VARIATION_COUNT):

**Variation [N]: [Name]**

- Concept: [2-3 sentence description of the design philosophy]
- Layout pattern: [e.g., grid-based dashboard, vertical timeline, card carousel]
- Key features: [Main UI elements and interactions]
- Best for: [User scenario or use case this excels at]

**Note:** Ensure each variation is meaningfully different from the others. If VARIATION_COUNT=1, still provide a well-thought-out design approach.

### Step 2: Implement in Parallel

Use the Task tool to launch **VARIATION_COUNT** general-purpose agents IN PARALLEL to implement each design variation.

**CRITICAL**: You MUST send a single message containing VARIATION_COUNT Task tool calls to run all agents simultaneously. Do NOT wait for one agent to complete before starting the next.

**Examples:**

- If VARIATION_COUNT=2: Send 1 message with 2 Task tool calls
- If VARIATION_COUNT=3: Send 1 message with 3 Task tool calls
- If VARIATION_COUNT=1: Send 1 message with 1 Task tool call

Each agent should receive a prompt following this structure:

```
Implement UI Design Variation [1/2/3]: [Variation Name]

Context:
- Original Brief: {{arg}}
- Feature Name: [feature-name] ← USE THIS EXACT NAME in all file paths
- Design Approach:
  - Concept: [concept from brainstorming]
  - Layout: [layout pattern]
  - Key Features: [key features list]
  - Target Use Case: [best for scenario]

Implementation Requirements:
1. Create HTML and CSS in directory: ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-[1/2/3]/
2. Use Tailwind 4 via CDN: <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
3. Include inline Tailwind config if needed for custom colors/spacing
4. Make the component immediately viewable by opening the HTML file in a browser
5. Use semantic HTML elements (nav, main, article, aside, section, header, footer)
6. Include basic accessibility (alt text, ARIA labels for interactive elements, keyboard navigation)
7. **IMPORTANT:** Use the exact feature name specified above for the directory structure

File Structure (use this exact pattern):
- ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-[1/2/3]/
  - index.html (main file - use a descriptive component name internally)
  - styles.css (optional, only if custom CSS beyond Tailwind is needed)
  - README.md (document design decisions, key features, and trade-offs)

Example: ui-design/dashboard-variation-1/index.html

Deliverable Requirements:
- Working HTML prototype with Tailwind 4 styling
- Include 8-12 items of realistic mock data (not Lorem ipsum)
- Show multiple states where applicable (empty, loading, populated, error)
- Responsive design considerations (mobile, tablet, desktop)
- Consider alignment with Spartan UI design principles where applicable

Deliverable:
A complete, immediately viewable HTML prototype that demonstrates the design variation.
All variations should use the SAME feature name, only the variation number differs.
```

Error Handling:

- Wait for all VARIATION_COUNT agents to complete
- If any agent fails, note which variation failed and why
- You may retry a failed agent once
- If retries fail, proceed to Step 3 with successful variations only

### Step 3: Create Comparison & Summary

After all agents complete, create a comparison page and summary.

#### 3.1: Generate Comparison Page

Create `ui-design/[feature-name]-comparison.html` that includes:

- Title: "UI Design Comparison: [Feature Name]"
- Brief description of the original brief
- **If validation was run:** Link to validation report at the top
- Side-by-side preview of all VARIATION_COUNT variations (use iframes or embedded views)
- **If validation was run:** Add validation badges/metrics below each variation preview
- Links to each individual HTML file
- Summary of each variation's approach
- Recommendations from the summary below
- **If validation was run:** Highlight best performer based on metrics

**Note:** Adapt the grid layout based on VARIATION_COUNT:

- 1 variation: Single centered view (max-width 1200px)
- 2 variations: 2-column grid
- 3 variations: 3-column grid
- 4 variations: 2x2 grid
- 5 variations: Use a responsive grid that adapts to viewport

#### 3.2: Update Design Catalog

Create or update `ui-design/INDEX.md` with an entry for this design session:

```markdown
## [Feature Name] - [YYYY-MM-DD]

**Brief:** [brief description]

**Variations:**

- [Variation 1 Name](./[feature-name]-variation-1/index.html) - [one-line description]
- [Variation 2 Name](./[feature-name]-variation-2/index.html) - [one-line description]
- [Variation 3 Name](./[feature-name]-variation-3/index.html) - [one-line description]

**Comparison:** [Link to comparison page](./[feature-name]-comparison.html)

**Recommendation:** [brief recommendation summary]

---
```

#### 3.3: Provide Summary

Provide a markdown summary comparing all VARIATION_COUNT variations with:

- **Comparison Table:** Side-by-side feature matrix for all variations
- **Strengths & Weaknesses:** For each variation
- **Use Cases:** When to use each approach
- **Recommendation:** For typical scenarios matching the brief (or single recommendation if VARIATION_COUNT=1)

### Step 3.5: Optional Validation (Playwright MCP)

**Trigger Conditions:**

- If `AUTO_VALIDATE=true`: Skip prompt and proceed directly to validation
- If `AUTO_VALIDATE=false`: Prompt the user with this message:

```
All [VARIATION_COUNT] design variation(s) have been generated successfully!

Would you like to run automated validation using Playwright MCP?
This will:
- Capture screenshots at multiple breakpoints (desktop 1920px, tablet 768px, mobile 375px)
- Run accessibility audits using axe-core (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Measure performance metrics (load time, DOM size, resource count)
- Verify basic interactions (forms, buttons, navigation)

Run validation? (yes/no):
```

**If user declines or Playwright MCP is not available:**

- Log a note that validation was skipped
- Proceed directly to Step 4

**If user accepts or AUTO_VALIDATE=true:**

1. **Check MCP Availability:**

   - Look for MCP tools with names starting with `mcp__playwright` or `mcp__` prefix
   - Check available tool list for Playwright-related MCP tools
   - If Playwright MCP tools are available: Use them directly (preferred method)
   - If not available: Fall back to using Playwright via npx (create Node.js script as backup)
   - **IMPORTANT:** Always prefer MCP tools over npx when available

2. **Run Validation Checks:**
   For each variation (1 through VARIATION_COUNT), use **Playwright MCP tool** (if available) or create a Playwright script to:

   a. **Screenshot Capture:**

   - Open `ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-[N]/index.html` in browser
   - Capture full-page screenshots at:
     - Desktop: 1920x1080px viewport
     - Tablet: 768x1024px viewport
     - Mobile: 375x667px viewport
   - Save to: `ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-[N]/screenshots/`

   b. **Accessibility Audit:**

   - Run axe-core accessibility scan
   - Report violations by severity (critical, serious, moderate, minor)
   - Save report to: `ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-[N]/a11y-report.json`

   c. **Performance Metrics:**

   - Measure page load time
   - Count DOM nodes
   - List resource requests (CSS, JS, images)
   - Save metrics to: `ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-[N]/performance.json`

   d. **Basic Interaction Tests:**

   - Verify all buttons are clickable
   - Check form inputs accept keyboard input
   - Confirm navigation links work
   - Test responsive menu (if present)
   - Log results

3. **Generate Validation Report:**
   Create `ui-design/[feature-name]-validation-report.html` with:

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
     <head>
       <title>Validation Report: [Feature Name]</title>
       <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
     </head>
     <body class="bg-gray-50 p-8">
       <div class="max-w-7xl mx-auto">
         <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">

                 <th>Variation 1</th>
                 <!-- ... Variation 2, 3, etc. as needed ... -->

       </div>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

4. **Analyze Results & Offer Adjustments:**

   **Critical Issues Detected:**

   - Broken layouts (elements overflow viewport)
   - Severe accessibility violations (missing alt text, no keyboard navigation)
   - Failed interactions (buttons don't respond)
   - Performance issues (load time > 3s)

   **If ANY critical issues found:**

   ```
   Validation found critical issues in [list affected variations]:
   - [List specific issues]

   Would you like me to automatically fix these issues and regenerate the affected variation(s)? (yes/no):
   ```

   **If user agrees:**

   - Re-run the Task agent for affected variation(s) with additional instructions:
     - "IMPORTANT: Fix these validation issues: [list issues]"
     - Include specific guidance (e.g., "add alt text to all images", "ensure buttons have visible focus states")
   - Re-run validation on fixed variation(s)
   - Update validation report with new results

   **If user declines or no critical issues:**

   - Proceed to Step 4

5. **Update Comparison Page:**
   - Add link to validation report at top of comparison page
   - Add validation summary badges to each variation preview
   - Include best performer highlight based on metrics

### Step 4: User Output & Next Steps

Provide the user with:

1. **File Paths:** Absolute paths to all generated files

   - `ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-1/index.html`
   - `ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-2/index.html`
   - `ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-3/index.html`
   - `ui-design/[feature-name]-comparison.html`
   - **If validation was run:** `ui-design/[feature-name]-validation-report.html`

2. **Viewing Instructions:**

   ```bash
   # Open comparison page to view all 3 variations side-by-side
   open ui-design/[feature-name]-comparison.html

   # If validation was run, view the detailed validation report
   open ui-design/[feature-name]-validation-report.html

   # Or open individual variations
   open ui-design/[feature-name]-variation-1/index.html
   ```

3. **Validation Summary** (if validation was run):

   - Overall best performer based on combined metrics
   - Key findings from accessibility audits
   - Performance comparison highlights
   - Critical issues fixed (if any)

4. **Next Steps Suggestions:**

   - **Run validation later:** Use `/ui-design [feature-name] --validate` on existing designs
   - **Refine a design:** Run `/ui-design [refined-brief focusing on chosen variation]`
   - **Implement in Angular:** Translate chosen design to Angular components using Spartan UI
   - **Share for feedback:** Send comparison page link to team members
   - **Iterate:** Make adjustments based on feedback and run command again
   - **Document decision:** Note which variation was chosen and why in project docs

5. **Design Catalog:** Link to `ui-design/INDEX.md` to view all past design sessions

## Usage Examples

### Default (2 variations, no validation)

```bash
/ui-design "create a user profile editor"
```

### Custom variation count

```bash
/ui-design "create a dashboard --count=4"
/ui-design "create a kanban board -n 3"
/ui-design "create a single landing page hero --variations=1"
```

### With validation

```bash
/ui-design "create a login form --validate"
/ui-design "create a checkout flow --count=3 --validate"
/ui-design "create a settings page -n 2 -v"
```

### Combining flags

```bash
/ui-design "create a data table --count=5 --validate"
/ui-design "create an analytics dashboard -n 4 -v"
```

**Flag Reference:**

- `--count=N`, `--variations=N`, `-n N`: Number of variations (1-5, default: 2)
- `--validate`, `-v`: Auto-run Playwright validation after generation
- Flags can appear anywhere in the brief and will be removed before processing
